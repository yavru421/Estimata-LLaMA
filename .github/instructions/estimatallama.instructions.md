Task: Create a single, callable Python script (integrate_llama.py) that integrates the logic from various example scripts to interact with the LLaMA API.
Context: The LLaMA API is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks. To simplify its usage, we want to create a unified Python script that encapsulates the necessary logic from various example scripts.
Instructions:

    Start by examining the existing example scripts in the repository, specifically those that demonstrate interactions with the LLaMA API (e.g., llama_api_example.py, text_generation_example.py, etc.).
    Identify the key functionalities and logic from these example scripts that need to be integrated into the new integrate_llama.py script. Some of these functionalities might include:
        Authentication and API key management
        Text generation and processing
        Conversational dialogue management
        Error handling and logging
    Using the identified functionalities, create a new Python script (integrate_llama.py) that imports the necessary libraries and modules.
    Design a class or function-based structure for the integrate_llama.py script that allows for a simple, unified interface to the LLaMA API. Consider using a modular design to keep related functionalities organized.
    Implement the necessary logic to handle the following tasks:
        Initialize the LLaMA API client with authentication credentials
        Generate text based on a given prompt or input
        Engage in conversational dialogue with the LLaMA API
        Handle errors and exceptions raised by the LLaMA API
        Log important events and errors
    To make the script callable, create a main function or a CLI (Command-Line Interface) using a library like argparse or click. This will allow users to interact with the script from the command line or by importing it as a module in other Python scripts.
    Ensure the script is well-documented with clear and concise comments, docstrings, and documentation.
    Test the integrate_llama.py script thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and handles various edge cases.

Example Use Cases:

    Generate text based on a prompt: python integrate_llama.py --generate-text --prompt &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
    Engage in conversational dialogue: python integrate_llama.py --converse --input &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;

API Documentation:
The integrate_llama.py script should expose a simple, unified API that can be used by other applications. The API should include the following endpoints or functions:

    generate_text(prompt: str) -&gt; str: Generates text based on the given prompt.
    converse(input: str) -&gt; str: Engages in conversational dialogue with the LLaMA API.

Deliverables:

    A single, callable Python script (integrate_llama.py) that integrates the necessary logic from various example scripts to interact with the LLaMA API.
    Clear and concise documentation for the script, including usage examples and API documentation.
